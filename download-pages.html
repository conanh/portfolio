				<p>Most of the projects I work on involve a team from the start; however, this one was championed and lead primarily by me. While during the pre-development phase I operated on my own, I was constantly consulting with and pulling others in for information, feedback, and validation.</p>

				<p>Working with key stakeholders was essential to the process of getting things right.</p>

				<h2>Uncovering the problem</h2>

				<p>One of the things I like doing when moving to a new project is to get to know and observe its end users. So, when I first joined the web team, I set up a meeting with the whole customer service department. Although I had pored over the website analytics for trends, this group has one-on-one conversations with those that struggle with and give up on our Internet presence. I asked them do a brain dump of all of the problems they see related to our website, and the list was...<em>long.</em></p>

				<div class="portfolio-image">

					<div class="caption">Aside from needing visual modernization, the old download page had several fairly serious usability problems.</div>
				</div>

				<p>Later, as part of two other projects, I did the same thing, each time with a more specific focus. One of the themes that came up during every meeting was the relatively high number of calls they got every day by people confused by the download page we have specifically for customers that own our products (vs. trial users).</p>

				<h2>Nothing exists in isolation</h2>

				<p>I began talking to people all over the company that had experience with, or a stake in, the download experience (product managers, instructional designers, technical support, customer service, eCommerce manager, etc.) for more insights. I also looked at usage numbers and behaviors in Google Analytics, NPS survey data, and set up events in Google Tag Manager to track how visitors were using the page.</p>

				<p>In identifying the specific points of confusion and the three main types of customers that came to that page, a correlation with earlier phases of their interaction with our products and website emerged. With a more complete understanding of the entire context, I sketched out the common finding-through-buying work flows to help me better understand the users' stories and moments of frustration. This process uncovered many <em>mostly</em> known small issues throughout that were collectively causing a lot of confusion. We also, clearly, had the opportunity to tighten up the entire experience so similar actions they performed (e.g. find and download the trial, evaluate it, find and purchase it, and later re-downloading it) actually felt familiar and contiguous.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Since one of the issues with the download experience for new customers was caused by the way the installer worked, I met with the product owner to discuss alternatives. Even though the issue had been around for a while it was very easy to fix; everyone just thought it was difficult so didn't bring it up.</p>


				<h2>Re-scoping and ideating</h2>

				<p>While my original plan was to just improve a couple of pages, I worked with several stakeholders to explore the idea of expanding the plan to include all of the pages related to our software. The goals expanded as well, to not only solve confusion of those who just purchased our software and wanted to download--or re-download--it, but to make the entire exploration, trial, post-purchase, and upgrade experience better.</p>

				<p>Along with improvements for our customers, I saw the opportunity to improve our ability to iterate. Even though we had a CMS, most of those pages needed to be updated by developers. This was one of the reasons the problems hadn't been addressed sooner. After consulting with the web staff, we found ways we could make nearly all of the content updatable by designers and content developers, while retaining the ability to dynamically adjust to new product releases.</p>

				<p>Given the large number of stakeholders that needed to be involved, along with the many types of content and calls to action presented during the existing work flow, I created a prioritized list of goals and problems to solve for the project, as well as for each page we'd be updating. This helped me focus work flow and UI designs later.</p>

				<p>From those goals, I also created metrics we'd use to measure the successfulness of the changes we'd made.</p>

				<p>Starting with one of the more important pages and the top two priorities, I began sketching out as many options as I could, iterating as I went based on how well I felt the designs would likely meet the primary goals of the pages. From the sketches and early input from others, I moved on to mockups to better communicate the implementations I had in mind to meet the goals. These, of course, went through several iterations as well.</p>

				</div>

				<h2>Making it happen</h2>

				<p>With initial mockups, prioritized goals, and a fairly comprehensive proposal, I sent them all to the stakeholders. Then I met with each individually to make sure they all had their questions answered and were able to give their full, honest feedback. I tried to focus the discussions around the problems we wanted to solve, priorities, and information that hadn't been taken into account yet.</p>

				<p>Of course, there were considerations I hadn't made, elements of the designs that weren't fully developed, and discussions about edge cases. At this stage especially, the list of priorities we'd all agreed on earlier really helped to progress the project forward instead of getting dragged down by the particular focus of each department.</p>

					<img src="./images/download7.png" alt="final mockups prepared for implementation">
					<div class="caption">A "final" mockup incorporating feedback from the many stakeholders, but staying true to the initial priorities of each page.</div>
				</div>

				<p>After refining the mockups, getting rough estimates on the scope of the work, and working with managers to get resources to make the project happen, the development started. As project manager, I split my time between sitting by the web developers and the content creators in Marketing. This allowed for easy communication when "small" issues or questions came up. As a result, there were never any surprises at our weekly status meeting.</p>

				<p>Also, when the constraints of our CMS didn't allow for full implementation of the original designs, we collaborated on alternatives that would still accomplish the goals to the same degree.</p>



				<h2>Measure, results, and iterations</h2>

				<p>As mentioned before, part of the original planning involved defining goals and metrics to measure if the project was successful. Aside from getting a baseline of related customer calls, I set up events and tracking in Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, and CrazyEgg (for heat maps).</p>

				<p>The first week after the new pages all went live, calls related to problems with the download pages went down from about 150 a week to three a week. In the weeks following, the average was about five a week. This was a huge win, not only for the time it saved our Customer Service department--allowing them to work on other crucial tasks--it was a strong indicator that the we'd reduced hiccups for customers trying to download our products.</p>

					<div class="caption">There was a huge drop in related calls after the new pages went live.<br> (data is approximate but very close to actual numbers)</div>
				</div>

				<p>However, we didn't stop there. Over the next many months, I continued to watch visitors' behavior, still measuring and iterating on the designs. While none of these changes had as strong an impact as the initial update, many of them addressed other usability issues that had been previously overshadowed.</p>
